# Simple Python Toolbox

## Description
This is my first project, which I have updated after enhancing my skills. The program serves as a versatile toolbox to 
perform everyday tasks such as:

    - Checking the length of a password
    - Performing basic calculations with a simple calculator
    - Counting words in a given sentence
    - Converting temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit

The program provides an interactive menu where users can select the task they want to perform, and it delivers results 
based on their choice. This toolbox is designed to simplify small yet common tasks in a single, user-friendly 
application.
